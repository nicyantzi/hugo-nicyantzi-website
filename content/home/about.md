# Hello and welcome!
<br/>
I am an MBA student with a focus on enterprise analytics at Dalhousie University in the Corporate Residency program. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from McGill University, where I was a member of the menâ€™s basketball team and later the Row to Podium program. My hobbies include rowing, cooking, and photography.  

Ultimately, I intend to leverage my computer science skills to help businesses make smart, data-driven decisions. In the past years, I've anchored successful teams at school, at work, on the court, on the water, and in my community. I'll bring that high-level leadership, drive, and ability to deliver to the next team I join.
